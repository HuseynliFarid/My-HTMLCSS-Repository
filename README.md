🚀 Rise.az - Investment Tracking Platform (Beta)
Rise.az is a web-based project designed to help users track real-time prices for precious assets like Gold, Oil, and Diamonds, providing a starting point for their investment journey.

"Greatest gains start with a calculated risk."

📌 About the Project
This project was created to provide transparency in financial markets and present trading material prices through a simple, user-friendly interface. It is currently built on a solid HTML5 foundation, focusing on data structure and accessibility.

🛠 Technologies Used
The current version of the project utilizes:

HTML5: For semantic structure and content layout.

SEO Optimization: Implementation of meta tags for better search engine visibility.

Hyperlinks: Integration with external global exchange resources (GoldPrice, OilPrice) for data verification.

📊 Investment Instruments
The platform tracks the following assets:

Gold: Live market prices and links for verification.

Oil: Energy market analytics and current rates.

Diamonds: Pricing for precious stones in the global market.

🚀 Roadmap (Future Goals)
I plan to develop this project over the next 1-2 years through the following phases:

CSS3 Integration: Developing a modern, responsive design for mobile and desktop compatibility.

PHP & Backend Development: Automating price updates via API integration (fetching live data without manual input).

User Dashboard: Implementing a secure login system for users to manage their own investment portfolios.

Database Management (MySQL): Storing historical price data for trend analysis.
